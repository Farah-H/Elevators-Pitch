# Elevator's Pitch 

My name is Farah. I have a background in Chemistry and Nuclear Engineering and throughout these degrees, not only have I been fascinated by technology's ability to rapidly change our day-to-day lives, I also thoroughly enjoyed the technical aspects of my studies, and specifically my Masters' Project, which was written in python. 

As someone who is organised and professional I realised that consultancy is a good fit for me. Although I enjoy technical tasks, I have also actively developed my communication and business skills thtough part time employment and also taking on leadership posittions at a aiesec, globl youth led organisation. 

One of my biggest achievements was successfully leading my local branch  to achieve a product growth award, by managing data on thhe finances, HR and sales performance of the whole branch, a sucess which also speaks for my emotional intelligenc, proven througgh my ability to drive performace and form connections in the team i managed.
