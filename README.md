# Elevator's Pitch 

My name is Farah and I have a background in Chemistry and Nuclear Engineering.I am fascinated by technology's ability to rapidly change our day-to-day lives and I thouroughly enjoyed the technical aspects of my studies, and specifically my Masters' Project, which was written in python. 

As someone who is highly organised and holds herself to high standards, I realised that a career in DevOps consultancy is a good fit for me because it combines my love for technology with my desire to be a jack of all trades and work with diverse teams. Although I enjoy technical tasks, I have also actively developed my communication and business skills thtough part time employment and also taking on leadership positions at AIESEC, a global youth led organisation which I have been a member of for 3 years. 

One of my biggest achievements in AIESEC was successfully managing my local branch by collecting and analysing data on the finances, HR and sales of the local branch using an excell tracker which I created from scratch. This tracker was also used as a workflow to note and track tasks in our weekly tasks, I didn't know it at the time but the way we were working was analogous to Agile methods. As a result of this cadence of accountability, we achieved a product growth award, for being the only local branch in the UK to increase sales in that term. This success also speaks for my emotional intelligence, proven through my ability to drive performace and build rapport wiithin my team, and my ability utilise technology to achieve a goal.
