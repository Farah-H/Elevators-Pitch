# Elevator's Pitch 

My name is Farah. I have a background in Chemistry and Nuclear Engineering and throughout these degrees, not only have I been fascinated by technology's ability to rapidly change our day-to-day lives, I also thoroughly enjoyed the technical aspects of my studies, and specifically my Masters' Project, which was written in python. 

As someone who is highly organised and holds herself to high standards, I realised that devops consultancy is a good fit for me as it combines my love for technology with my desire to be a jack of all trades, and work with diverse teams to bridge gaps in communication. Although I enjoy technical tasks, I have also actively developed my communication and business skills thtough part time employment and also taking on leadership posittions at a aiesec, globl youth led organisation. 

One of my biggest achievements in AIESEC was successfully managing my local branch by managing data on thhe finances, HR and sales using an tracker which I created from scratch. As a result, we achieved a product growth award, a sucess which also speaks for my emotional intelligenc, proven througgh my ability to drive performace and form connections in the team i managed.
